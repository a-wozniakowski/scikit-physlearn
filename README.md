scikit-physlearn
=========================================

**scikit-physlearn** is a Python package for single-target and multi-target regression tasks. 
It is designed to follow the scikit-learn API with data representations in pandas. 
The model dictionary provides streamlined access to regressors in scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Mlxtend. The object ```ModifiedPipeline``` offers the ability to boost any of these regressors with a modified gradient boosting initialization, as described in *Boosting on the shoulders of giants in quantum device calibration*.

The repository was started by Alex Wozniakowski during his graduate studies at Nanyang Technological University.
