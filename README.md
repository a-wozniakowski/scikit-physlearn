scikit-physlearn
=========================================

**scikit-physlearn** is a Python module for single-target and multi-target regression tasks
with support for base boosting. It is designed to follow the scikit-learn API with pandas data representations 
and a model dictionary with quick access to scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Mlxtend regressors.

The repository was started by Alex Wozniakowski during his graduate studies at Nanyang Technological University.
