Scikit-physlearn Manual
=======================

Welcome! Scikit-physlearn is a Python package, which is designed to
amalgamate 
`Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_,
`LightGBM <https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_,
`XGBoost <https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
`CatBoost <https://catboost.ai/>`_,
and `Mlxtend <http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/>`_ 
regressors into a unified framework:

- Follows the Scikit-learn API.
- Represents data in pandas.
- Supports transfer of prior domain knowledge to `gradient boosting <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06194>`_.

The `repository <https://github.com/a-wozniakowski/scikit-physlearn>`_ was
started by Alex Wozniakowski during his graduate studies at Nanyang
Technological University.
