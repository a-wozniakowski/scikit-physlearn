scikit-physlearn
=========================================

**scikit-physlearn** is a Python module for single-target and multi-target regression,
which supports base boosting. The API follows scikit-learn, data is represented with pandas,
and there is a model dictionary with quick access to a variety of regressors from scikit-learn,
LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Mlxtend.
